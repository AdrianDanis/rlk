# Rust Little Kernel

Beginnings of yet another kernel written in Rust. This one based off the idea of Little Kernels.
Not much more to say here yet.

## Usage

Assume rust, cargo and xargo are all installed and you have qemu installed then perform one time setup by

```sh
rustup override set nightly
source setup.sh
```

And then just

```sh
xargo run
```
